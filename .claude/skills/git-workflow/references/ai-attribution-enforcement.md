## Git Hooks

**Automated Enforcement:**

You can create a git hook to automatically block commits with forbidden text:

```bash
# .git/hooks/commit-msg
#!/bin/bash

COMMIT_MSG_FILE=$1
COMMIT_MSG=$(cat "$COMMIT_MSG_FILE")

# Check for forbidden patterns
if echo "$COMMIT_MSG" | grep -iE "(claude|anthropic|AI-generated|AI-assisted|Generated with|Powered by|Co-Authored-By: Claude)" > /dev/null; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Commit message contains forbidden AI attribution"
    echo ""
    echo "Remove any references to:"
    echo "  - Claude, Anthropic, AI tools"
    echo "  - 'Generated with', 'Powered by', 'Co-Authored-By: Claude'"
    echo "  - Emojis with tool attribution"
    echo ""
    echo "Keep commit messages professional and clean."
    exit 1
fi

exit 0
```

**Installation:**
```bash
# Make hook executable
chmod +x .git/hooks/commit-msg
```

## Violation Detection

**Before pushing, check your commits:**

```bash
# Check last 5 commits for attribution
git log -5 --pretty=format:"%s%n%b" | grep -iE "(claude|anthropic|AI-generated|Generated with)"

# If output is empty, you're good to push
# If output shows matches, fix those commits
```

**Fixing attributed commits:**

```bash
# If last commit has attribution
git commit --amend
# Remove attribution, save, and push with --force-with-lease

# If multiple commits have attribution
git rebase -i HEAD~5
# Mark commits as 'edit', remove attribution, continue rebase
```

## Why This Matters

1. **Professional Appearance:** Repositories should reflect our work, not tools used
2. **Ownership Clarity:** Clear that code is our intellectual property
3. **Client Expectations:** Banking/regulated clients expect professional presentation
4. **Brand Consistency:** Maintains AINative Studio brand without third-party attribution
5. **Legal Protection:** Avoids questions about code authorship and ownership

## This is a ZERO-TOLERANCE rule. No exceptions.
